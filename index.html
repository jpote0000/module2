    <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
    <h2>Robert Frost (1874-1963)</h2>

    <main>
        <p>
            Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
            And sorry I could not travel both<br>
            And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
            And looked down one as far as I could<br>
            To where it bent in the undergrowth;
        </p>
        <p>
            Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
            And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
            Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
            Though as for that the passing there<br>
            Had worn them really about the same,
        </p>
        <p>
            And both that morning equally lay<br>
            In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
            Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
            Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
            I doubted if I should ever come back.
        </p>
        <p>
            I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
            Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
            I took the one less traveled by,<br>
            And that has made all the difference.
